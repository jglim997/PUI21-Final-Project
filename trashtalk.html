            </h5>
            <p>
                With the rise of global warming and toxic waste, sustainable waste management practices
                help to save and preserve our environment. <u>But do people know how to recycle and compost
                properly?</u> Many institutions, such as Carnegie Mellon University strive to implement proper
                waste management instructions for students and staff members to follow. However, waste management
                remains a very confusing ordeal. <br><br>The proper identification and sorting of compost 
                and recyclable materials are essential.

                DOMAIN & USER RESEARCH
        </h3>
        <h5>
                "It's confusing on what is compostable and what is not."
        </h5>
        <p>
                We initially researched general waste management topics such as toxic waste, landfills, and 
                reusing waste to better understand the foundation and cause of sustainability. Through this secondary
                research, we realized that in order to create a solution that would create positive impacts for sustainability, we
                needed to narrow down our audience. As a result, we chose to pursue a more relatable audience
                to learn more about; we chose to focus on sustainability at Carnegie Mellon University through secondary and guerilla research. 
                <br><br>
                We interviewed <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/staff-council/representatives/kviz-barb.html">Barbara Kviz</a>, coordinator of sustainability and green practice initiatives on campus. 
                She provided many insightful pieces of information about what she wishes could be improved in how the university
                manages its waste; she struggles with educating community members on how to compost properly. Many composting bins
                on campus are often contaminated due to improper placement of waste and therefore must be thrown away.

        <p>
            We mapped out a customer's journey in managing waste. In doing so, we were able to identify
            key painpoints and therefore key opportunities to set the foundations of our designs. 
            The opportunities that we decided to focus more on included, reducing single-use, non-compostable packaging and creating
            an incentive to recycle properly. 
            Many of these opportunities aligned with the research and information we had gathered from our secondary and guerilla research.

            PERSONAS
        </h3>
        <p>
            For our personas, our problem space was divided into the customer, service provider, and business owner.
            Any member of the CMU community would be a potential user of our system/solution as a customer. 
            Our service provider would be modeled after Barbara Kviz, the sustainability director at CMU with whom
            we spoke with earlier. As for our business owner, we considered the Financial Officer at CMU, a figure whom
            funds these sustainability initiatives as a good representation with the perspective of how these initiatives
            can add value to the institute.

    <h3> 
        SCENARIOS & STORYBOARDING
    </h3>

    <p>
        Following the creation of our personas, we created scenarios and storyboards based off of user needs.
        From 6 scenarios, we chose two and created storyboards for both. From there, through a speed-dating session, we finalized our storyboard.
        <br><br>
        User Needs:
        <ul>
            <li>Obtaining information about what is compostable/recyclable and what is not</li>
            <li>Incentivizing the act of composting and recycling</li>
            <li>Showing the impacts of poor waste management</li>
            <li>Showing the correct ways to dispose of trash</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>SITEMAP</h3>
    
    <img src="images/siteflow.svg" width="100%" alt="">
    <br><br>
    
    <p>
        We started by individually listing out all the potential features we would want our application to have. Next,
        we combined our features together in a low-level affinity cluster. We made sure that the insights we had gathered
        from our research and feedback from our storyboards were being addressed by our designs. We first prototyped
        the mobile design, making it easier to extend and add features when moving to a larger desktop screen rather 
        than scaling down. <br><br>Lastly, we discovered that our mobile version would have more practical uses due to the camera feature 
        and portability benefits, whereas the desktop site would be more useful for finding more information about sustainability and events.
        
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>PROTOTYPING</h3>
    <P>
        From quick sketching, we used Figma to produce low-fidelity prototypes. With low-fidelity prototyping,
        we were able to see how elements of our application would fit together. From critiques and multiple
        iterations, we produced higher fidelity prototypes that we continued to develop for our final pitch.
        The mobile design became our primary focus with the camera function.

    <h3>
        ADDING VALUE
    </h3>
    <p>
        With trashtalk, there are stronger incentives and benefits that each persona and user is able to gain
        from composting. With the system of awarding dining credit to people like Tom  within the university 
        community, there is a complete circle of value that promotes sustainable practices.

        TAKEAWAYS
    </h3>
    <p>
        With the design process, I learned and honed my skills in identifying a problem, conducting the relevant
        research needed for the problem space, synthesizing the results to a defined direction, and iterating on
        a mobile design solution. This project allowed me to work on a comprehensive, full development cycle design project.
